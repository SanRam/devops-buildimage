# Config file for ansible -- https://ansible.com/
# =======================================================

# Nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook
# or with command line flags. Ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG,
# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in
# the home directory, or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it
# finds first
